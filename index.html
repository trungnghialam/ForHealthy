								<h2>IT Technologies</h2>

							<p>In this section we are going to talk about the following IT technologies.</p>
							<p>Clouds, services, servers<br>
							Cloud computing is a paradigm that allows on-demand network access to shared computing resources. The state of art of this
							technology is its 3 models SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS
							(Infrastructure as a Service).
							</p>
							<p>Autonomous Vehicles can also be known as driverless cars or you can simply say cars on auto pilot. This
							is one of the most emerging technologies these days. The cars are definitely getting smarter and the
							concept of autonomous vehicles is undoubtedly getting better and better with the progress the different
							companies have shown but the day we will be able to buy one of these cars or even ride in one is a lot
							further out then it may seem.</p>
							<p>Blockchains and Crytocurrency:
							A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is completely open to anyone, they have interesting property: once some data has been
							recorded inside a blockchain, it becomes very difficult to change. Each block contains some data the
							hash of the block and the hash of the previous block. The data that is stored inside the block depends on
							the type of block chain; For Example the bitcoin blockchain consist of details about a transaction such as
							sender receiver and the amount of coins.</p>
							<p>Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots:
							Natural Language Processing or NLP is an area of computer science that involves processing
							(understanding and synthesizing) of spoken and/or written language. It is meant to enable interactions
							between human and machines in humans in a ‘language’ that is more natural for humans.</p>

								<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								During two assignments learning, we have a simple understanding of IT, including what it is and
							its developments over the past few decades. These basic knowledges were guiding us think about
							what we can learn from other courses and how that knowledge could help us have self-
							improvements. Meanwhile, we searched online about many IT jobs, not only know what kinds of
							IT skills were required by different jobs but also what do these jobs do and challenges that
							employees would deal with at work.
							Also, we reported some of IT technologies, which we have heard about in our daily life and other
							courses. We learned what does them do and knew what prospects they have in every industry.
							More importantly, how these technologies and related products would impact our life, either better
							or not.
							Overall, our project idea covers many aspects and conclusions of many problems we met. Firstly,
							about IT, learn some basic knowledge about IT. Then, how those IT skills we learned from another
							course could help us for job hunting. Every member in our group got their interesting job, and
							know those jobs need what kinds of IT skills. Finally, in the IT field, what advanced technologies
							are produced and improved. We also found some interests in these technologies which could
							encourage us to learn more about them.

								<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								We did a lot of rush, and the communication was not smooth, and we didn't come out to meet and finish the homework together.
								When this plan is being worked out, not everyone was involved, but everyone did not object and started to execute.
								We should use software like Google Docs to promote teamwork. Now we completed our parts and lacked real partnership.
								Our next assignment is expected to improve this issue, plan earlier and improve communication. Furthermore, our group was working
								on this project very well. Every member in group have completed all their parts with lots of information. However, every member in
								our group is still shy and not confident in English so that made our group were facing with communication problem.
								Another problem, we did not have enough knowledge about HTML and we did spend too much time on researching. Fortunately,
								we have done this HTML and we also have learnt some things from this project. We have been patient and solving any problems that
								we were dealing with and we can share every personal information or cultures from every member in our group.Overall the group coordination went very well and I think we have done a good job in this assignment;
								everyone was keen to work and did their part on time and in orderly manner.
